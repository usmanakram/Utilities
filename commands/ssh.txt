For ssh login, user's public key should be there at server (~/home/<username>/.ssh/authorized_keys)

To generate ssh keys
	$ ssh-keygen
	OR
	$ ssh-keygen -t rsa

Copy public key from local system (~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) to server (~/.ssh/authorized_keys)
	$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh <username>@<server ip> "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >>  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"

To connect to the server via SSH, run the following command from a terminal:
	$ ssh username@ip.add.re.ss

To copy file from local machine to server
	$ scp <local file path> <username>@<server ip>:<server directory path>

To add private key before using (only first time), if it's name is other than "id_rsa"
	$ ssh-add <file path of rsa private key>
	if says "Could not open a connection to your authentication agent." then run following command first
	$ eval `ssh-agent -s`

To reload sshd service
	$ sudo systemctl reload sshd
