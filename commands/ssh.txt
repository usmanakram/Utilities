For ssh login, user's public key should be there at server (~/home/<username>/.ssh/authorized_keys)

To generate ssh keys
	$ ssh-keygen
	OR
	$ ssh-keygen -t rsa

Copy public key from local system (~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) to server (~/.ssh/authorized_keys)
	$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh <username>@<server ip> "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >>  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"

To connect to the server via SSH, run the following command from a terminal:
	$ ssh -p 2222 username@ip.add.re.ss
	OR
	$ ssh username@ip.add.re.ss

Connect through terminal using rsa key
	$ ssh -i <keyfile path> username@ip.add.re.ss

To copy file from local machine to server
	$ scp <local file path> <username>@<server ip>:<server directory path>
	For specific port
	$ scp -P 2222 <local file path> <username>@<server ip>:<server directory path>
On the other hand if you are on the computer wanting to receive file from a remote computer:
	$ scp username@remote:/file/to/send /where/to/put
`scp` can also send files between two remote hosts:
	$ scp username@remote_1:/file/to/send username@remote_2:/where/to/put

To add private key before using (only first time), if it's name is other than "id_rsa"
	$ ssh-add <file path of rsa private key>
	if says "Could not open a connection to your authentication agent." then run following command first
	$ eval `ssh-agent -s`
	OR
	$ ssh-agent /bin/sh

To reload sshd service
	$ sudo systemctl reload sshd

Disable root ssh login using password
	$ sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	Change propertey "PermitRootLogin" from "yes" to "no" and "PasswordAuthentication" from "yes" to "no"
