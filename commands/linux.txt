The most important command is "tail". Tail can be used to read the last lines from a file. Examples:
Get the last 100 lines from the Debian mail log file:
	$ tail -n 100 /var/log/mail.log

To get all newly added lines from a log file in realtime on the shell, use the command:
	$ tail -f /var/log/mail.log

To connect to the server via SSH, run the following command from a terminal:
	$ ssh -p 2222 cpanelusr@ip.add.re.ss

To remove a directory that contains other files or directories, use the following command.
	$ rm -r <directory name>

Executing the above command would delete all files and directories in the directory named in the command. However, it would also present a prompt for approval to delete each of the files. If you don't want to receive a prompt for each file, use the following command instead.
	$ rm -rf <directory name>
