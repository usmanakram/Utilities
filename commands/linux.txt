To connect to the server via SSH, run the following command from a terminal:
	$ ssh -p 2222 username@ip.add.re.ss

Connect through terminal using rsa key
	ssh -i <keyfile path> username@ip.add.re.ss

Create file
	$ touch <file name>

Edit file
	$ vim <file name>
	Press "i" for insert mode
	Enter anthing you want to put as content
	Press Esc then ":wq!" for save & exit

	$ cat <file name>

The most important command is "tail". Tail can be used to read the last lines from a file. Examples:
Get the last 100 lines from the Debian mail log file:
	$ tail -n 100 /var/log/mail.log

To get all newly added lines from a log file in realtime on the shell, use the command:
	$ tail -f /var/log/mail.log

Create directory
	$ mkdir <directory name>

To remove a directory that contains other files or directories, use the following command.
	$ rm -r <directory name>

Executing the above command would delete all files and directories in the directory named in the command. However, it would also present a prompt for approval to delete each of the files. If you don't want to receive a prompt for each file, use the following command instead.
	$ rm -rf <directory name>
