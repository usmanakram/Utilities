The most important command is "tail". Tail can be used to read the last lines from a file. Examples:
Get the last 100 lines from the Debian mail log file:
	tail -n 100 /var/log/mail.log

To get all newly added lines from a log file in realtime on the shell, use the command:
	tail -f /var/log/mail.log

To connect to the server via SSH, run the following command from a terminal:
	ssh -p 2222 cpanelusr@ip.add.re.ss
