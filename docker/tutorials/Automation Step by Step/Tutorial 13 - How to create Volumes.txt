Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers


: docker volume  //get information
: docker volume create
: docker volume ls
: docker volume inspect
: docker volume rm
: docker volume prune


Use of Volumes
===========
Decoupling container from storage
Share volume (storage/data) among different containers
Attach volume to container
On deleting container volume does not delete



Commands
docker run --name MyJenkins1 -v myvol1:/var/jenkins_home -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins
docker run --name MyJenkins2 -v myvol1:/var/jenkins_home -p 9090:8080 -p 60000:50000 jenkins
docker run --name MyJenkins3 -v /Users/raghav/Desktop/Jenkins_Home:/var/jenkins_home -p 9191:8080 -p 40000:50000 jenkins

Testing:
docker run --name MyJenkins1 -v /Users/usmanakram/Desktop/docker/tutorial13/Jenkins_Home:/var/jenkins_home -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins
docker run --name MyJenkins2 -v /Users/usmanakram/Desktop/docker/tutorial13/Jenkins_Home:/var/jenkins_home -p 9090:8080 -p 60000:50000 jenkins





NOTES

By default all files created inside a container are stored on a writable container layer

The data doesn’t persist when that container is no longer running

A container’s writable layer is tightly coupled to the host machine where the container is running. You can’t easily move the data somewhere else.

Docker has two options for containers to store files in the host machine
so that the files are persisted even after the container stops

VOLUMES  and  BIND MOUNTS

Volumes are stored in a part of the host filesystem which is managed by Docker

Non-Docker processes should not modify this part of the filesystem

Bind mounts may be stored anywhere on the host system

Non-Docker processes on the Docker host or a Docker container can modify them at any time

In Bind Mounts, the file or directory is referenced by its full path on the host machine. 


Volumes are the best way to persist data in Docker

volumes are managed by Docker and are isolated from the core functionality of the host machine

A given volume can be mounted into multiple containers simultaneously.

When no running container is using a volume, the volume is still available to Docker and is not removed automatically. You can remove unused volumes using "$ docker volume prune".

When you mount a volume, it may be named or anonymous. 

Anonymous volumes are not given an explicit name when they are first mounted into a container

Volumes also support the use of volume drivers, which allow you to store your data on remote hosts or cloud providers, among other possibilities.
