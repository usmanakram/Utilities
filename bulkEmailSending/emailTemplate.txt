Dear ----- , 

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Ryan Umar, and I represent the Big League Shirts. I wanted to take a moment to introduce our company and discuss how our innovative solutions can benefit your league.

I understand that price, quality, and lead time are big factors when deciding what uniform company to use.  I am confident that we can deliver on all three with great quality uniforms, quick turnaround time on both custom artwork and final product, as well as the best pricing in the industry.

At Big League Shirts, we specialize in providing customized uniforms with a rush shipping time of 20 days. With our expertise and proven track record, we partnered with numerous clubs/teams/leagues having big names of USA Archery, KS Rebels in providing qualitative and economical uniforms.

You can visit our website here https://bigleagueshirts.com/ to have a look at our products and services also. I request you to consider Big League Shirts as a potential partner. We are confident that our solutions can make a significant impact on your League.

I look forward to the opportunity of working together to achieve your business goals. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

Ryan Umar
